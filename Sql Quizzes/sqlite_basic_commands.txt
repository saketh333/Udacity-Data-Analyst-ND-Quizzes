Sqlite 
commands

to load a database navigate to the folder in command prompt and type
cd your/file/path/chinook_db
sqlite3 chinook.db
sqlite>

Running some basic commands
You can use the .help command at any time to find details about all your new database functions.
sqlite> .help
Try .tables to see what tables are in your database.
sqlite> .tables
If you're interested in the schema of your tables the .schema command is perfect for you.
sqlite> .schema Album

CREATE TABLE [Album]
(
[AlbumId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
[Title] NVARCHAR(160)  NOT NULL,
[ArtistId] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT [PK_Album] PRIMARY KEY  ([AlbumId]),
FOREIGN KEY ([ArtistId]) REFERENCES [Artist] ([ArtistId]) 
    ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [IPK_Album] ON [Album]([AlbumId]);
CREATE INDEX [IFK_AlbumArtistId] ON [Album] ([ArtistId]);
The .schema command returns a ton of useful information so it's worth understanding what's going on here.
From this output you can see the table name, column names, datatypes, primary keys, and foreign keys. You've seen all of these before but maybe not collected together so densely.
Here's a quick breakdown of sections that are important for you starting out.
CREATE TABLE [Album] <-- This is the table name, Album.

[AlbumId] <---These are your column names
[Title]       This table has 3.
[ArtistId]    AlbumId, Title, ArtistId

            INTEGER,       <---Next are the datatypes
            NVARCHAR(160),     Each column needs a datatype
            INTEGER,           You learned these last lesson!         
The rest of the output you see are various CONSTRAINTS placed on the database. Databases have primary keys, foreign keys, and NULL value constraints.
This is what these lines are doing. You'll learn how to do this later. For now you can focus finding the table and column names.
NOTE: If you don't specify a table the .schema command will return the schema for all tables in the database. 

Start Querying your Data!
The Chinook database is an iTunes library representing a digital music store. We'll be getting very familiar with this database throughout these problem sets. If you want some more information on this database have a look at the Chinook database homepage.
So now you've seen the table names in this database. Let's have a look at all the data from the Invoice table.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Invoice;
Your first query, AWESOME!
Now check out what's in the Employee table.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Employee;
Can you find anything interesting about the other tables in your database?
Stay curious, explore everything!
When you're all done exploring you can .exit the database.
sqlite> .exit
