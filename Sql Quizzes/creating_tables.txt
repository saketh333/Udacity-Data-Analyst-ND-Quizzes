##  After all the success promoting your music tour last section, 
##  a new friend has asked to partner up and build your own music website!
##  You'll need to rebuild your own database and import the data to your new system.

##  Let's first take a closer look at how to build and populate your local database.
##  The box below shows the Album table schema including Primary and Foreign Keys.
##  Have a look at this table and the CREATE TABLE statement below to see how they 
##  relate.

'''
First, disconnect from your Chinook database.
> .exit

Create a new database named whatever you'd like your store to be called.
$ sqlite3 UdaciousMusic.db

Now we can populate this database with our first table.

Here's a graphic showing some information about the Album table.
We can use this to build a table in our new database.

######################################################################
#                         Table: Album                               #
######################################################################
+--------------------+---------------+-----------------+--------------+
|      Columns       |   Data Type   |    Primary Key  |  Foreign Key |
+====================+===============+=================+==============+ 
|      AlbumId           INTEGER            YES              NO       |
|      Title             TEXT               NO               NO       |
|      ArtistId          INTEGER            NO               YES      |
|      UnitPrice         REAL               NO               NO       |
|      Quantity          INTEGER            NO               NO       |
+====================+===============+=================+==============+ 

We can use this information to decide how our schema should look.
Do you see how the schema below reflects the table above?

CREATE TABLE Album
(
    AlbumId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Title TEXT,
    ArtistId INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (ArtistId) REFERENCES Artist (ArtistId) 
);

Try pasting the schema into your local database.  
Let's check to see if anything happened.

sqlite> .tables
Album <--- Do you see the Album table?  I hope so!

Now, do we have any data in our new table?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM Album;

Do you see data?  I hope not, we haven't added any yet!

Open the Album.sql tab.  You can copy and paste these lines directly into 
your sqlite terminal. (Use Ctrl+A or Command+A to select all lines when the
code editor is selected to select all the lines at once.)

Now try to run your query again.  You've got data... NICE!

'''
##  Use the previous example to help you construct the InvoiceLine table.
##  When you're ready, run you query to CREATE and populate the InvoiceLine table 
##  using data from the InvoiceLine.sql file. 

QUERY='''
CREATE TABLE InvoiceLine
(
    InvoiceLineId INTERGER PRIMARY KEY,
    InvoiceId INTERGER,
    TrackId INTERGER,
    UnitPrice REAL,
    Quantity INTERGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (InvoiceId) REFERENCES Invoice (InvoiceId),
    FOREIGN KEY (TrackId) REFERENCES Track (TrackId)
);

##  These examples should help you build any remaining tables from the Chinook database.

##  Use .schema when connected to the Chinook database to see the tables and columns 
##  in your Chinook database, and try recreating them in your new database.
##  You can populate these tables using the sql files from the Downloadables section, or 
##  with CSV files, which you'll learn to do next!
